I am starting this blog, using astro framework to build this static generated site, using markdown.
I recently started using leet code and code crafters to exercise my knowledge in programming, 
but as I'm a beginner using Rust, first I want to learn more about it, before trying to do any other challenge.

First, I'm learning Rust through this Microsoft's tutorial, than I'm going to start studying the official docs.
https://learn.microsoft.com/pt-br/training/paths/rust-first-steps/

Thanks, for reading, hope this is a first small step to a bigger and contentful blog.
